                <p class="intro">An engineer who has decided to spread her wings to the world of programming.
                    Like Elbert Hubbard quoted; The world is moving so fast these days that the man who says it can't be
                    done is generally interrupted by someone doing it.
                    With this i decided the only way out is to upskill and move with the world. This is my motivation
                    and will remain to be untill i perfect the skill.</p>
