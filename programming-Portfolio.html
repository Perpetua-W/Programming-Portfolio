    <h4> ABOUT ME </h4>
      <p class="intro">I'm an engineer who has decided to spread her wings to the world of programming.
      Like Elbert Hubbard quoted; The world is moving so fast these days that the man who says it can't be done is generally interrupted by someone doing it.
      With this i decided the only way out is to upskill and move with the world. This is my motivation and will remain to be untill i perfect the skill.</p>
